      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>
        I am software developer in WÃ¼rzburg, Germany. My interests are
        <span class="bold"
          >React, Typescript, design systems and component libraries</span
        >
        and other technologies for frontend developing. What exites me most
        about software engineering is that I can
        <span class="bold">combine creativity and technology.</span>

      <p>Some facts about me:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          When I went to school, I could not imagine to work with computers and
          programming languages
        </li>
        <li>
          When I am not sitting in front of the computer, I like to draw or to

      <h3>Webdevelopment like 15 Years Ago â€“ The new Fullstack Frameworks</h3>
      <p>
        <span class="bold">Summary: </span>Do you remember your first web
        projects based on PHP & Co? Back then it was difficult to develop
        interactive web applications. So we were all happy when the first
        single-page Applications appeared. But some frameworks are now
        introducing server-side rendering, which raises questions for many
        developers. Why is server-side rendering better today then it was back
        then? Are fullstack frameworks the end of single-page applications? What
        is the UX like for an application that is rendered on the server? Using
        React Remix as an example, we want to demonstrate how a full-stack
        framework works and find out whether server-side rendering is better
        today than it was 15 years ago.
