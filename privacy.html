        When you are visiting this website, the following data is recorded: your
        IP-adress, your user agent, the site you requested and the time at which
        you did it. This is done by my provider in order to ensure the service
        and to defend attacks. Your IP-adress is anonymized after at most four
        weeks by deleting its last eight bits. The remaining data is kept by my
        provider for statistical reasons. It cannot be connected to your person
        any more.
